# Developer Chaos - Reheated
Hot Potato: Reheated is a revision of the results of the original Hot Potato event. The goal of this revision is to polish some of the flawed ideas present in this mod due to the time constraints of the event. In addition, this revision seeks to add interactions between the disjoint mechanics of this mod, which were disjoint because of the rules of the event preventing communication between teams.

From the original repo:
> "Hot Potato is a Balatro Mod Developer Event where teams were created and given a week on their own to contribute to a mod. Cross-team communication was not allowed outside of major bugfixing efforts. The ordeal took 2 months, and this mod is the culmination of this work."

***Note about compatibility:*** While this mod will remain updated with bugfixes from the original Hot Potato repository, the goal of this revision is not to expand compatibility to other mods.

## Note:
Hot Potato was not designed with cross-content mod compatibility in mind. It is recommended to not play Hot Potato with other mods installed. If you forego this warning, expect things to break!!

***If you are experiencing a crash on startup,*** please be sure that your folders are not **nested**. If your Mod's folder looks like `Balatro/Mods/Hot-Potato/Hot-Potato/<mod files here>`, cut and paste the mod files from the second folder to the first, so that the mod's files are only one "layer" deep. The Mod's folder should look like this: `Balatro/Mods/Hot-Potato/<mod files here>`.

**If your mod folder looks correct and you are still experiencing crashes of any kind**, please create an issue on this repository, or send a crash log in the mod's [thread in the Balatro Discord](https://discord.com/channels/1116389027176787968/1397989781178155009).
